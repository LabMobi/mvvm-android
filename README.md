# MVVM-Kotlin library


## Using the Android Studio Template

To make your life a little easier, we have created a template for creating Activity, Fragment, Contract, ViewModel and Model classes for you.
Simply copy the ``MvvmTemplate`` folder to following directory:

```
{{ANDROID_STUDIO_LOCATION}/plugins/android/lib/templates/other/
```

On MacOs:

```
/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/plugins/android/lib/templates/other/
```
